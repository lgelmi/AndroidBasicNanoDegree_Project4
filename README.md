FÃ¨rDeCavall - An italian Folk dream

Nothing special this time. Since a colleague was is a band called "Menagrama" and I buyed their album, I decided to make an album-app with those songs. Reduced to 30 seconds for preserving the copyrights (there are plenty of link to get the complete ones). 

Most app data are taken from a JSON file. The app itself is structured to be adapted to further activities (e.g. lyrics)

As extra, I integrated any social link that occurred to me: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Spotify. These will try to open the associated apps if available, otherwise they will open the browser.
